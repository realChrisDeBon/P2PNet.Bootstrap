P2PNet.Bootstrap is meant to facilitate P2PNet peer networks through initial peer discovery. The P2PNet.Bootstrap server is a WAN discovery mechanism that should be built upon a static fault-tolerant system.
Directing a P2PNet peer to a bootstrap server will lead the new peer to attempt to connect to all recognized members.
